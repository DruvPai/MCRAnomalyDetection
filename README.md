# MCR Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection through the principle of [Maximal Coding Rate Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08558).
Course project for EE 290, Fall 2020 offering, at UC Berkeley.

Codebase forked from [ryanchankh/mcr2](https://github.com/ryanchankh/mcr2).

To use: install Conda environment in `environment.yml`, but first replace the `cudatoolkit` version in `environment.yml`. [Instructions here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

Then you can look at the instructions on [ryanchankh/mcr2](https://github.com/ryanchankh/mcr2) -- for now these are the same, but eventually we will add a module for anomaly detection.
